# Rock Paper Scissors

In this project, I will be developing a simple implementation of "Rock Paper Scissors." The game will be played on the browser console for now, but I will be revisiting this project in the near future to implement a front end. 

## Information and Goals

* Create a blank HTML document with a script tag. The game will be played completely from the console – No front end at the moment except for a button that starts the game.

* The game will be played against the computer, so the program begins with a function that randomly returns 'Rock,' 'Paper,' or 'Scissors.'

* Another function will be created that takes two parameters (Respective User and Computer selections) and returns a string that declares the winner of the round.

* One last function is made to run the previous function and allow the user to play five rounds of Rock Paper Scissors. It will also keep score and report a winner/loser at the conclusion of the game.

* User input should be case insensitive ('Rock,' 'RoCK, 'rock,' etc.)

* Use Git and push code to GitHub when necessary.

* When stuck, seek help (Google, etc.)
