# Rock Paper Scissors

In this project, I will be developing a simple implementation of "Rock Paper Scissors." The game will be played on the browser console for now, but I will be revisting this project in the near future to implement a front end. 

## Information and Goals

* Create a blank HTML document with a script tag. The game will be played completely from the console - No front end at the moment

* The game will be played against the computer, so the program begins with a function that randamly returns 'Rock,'Paper,' or 'Scissors'

* Another function will be created that takes two parameters (Respective User and Computer selections) and returns a string that declares the winner of the round

* One last function is made to put the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner/loser at the conclusion of the game

* User input should be insensitive ('Rock,' 'RoCK, 'rock,' etc.)

* Use Git and push code to GitHub when necessary

* When stuck, seek help (Google, etc.)
